      <p>I don't want to live here anymore. Pittsburgh is a city in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. A population of about 302,407 (2018) residents live within the city limits, making it the
        66th-largest city in the U.S. The

      <h3>Best Sports City</h3>
      <p>I don't care about sports. Pittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—share the
        same team colors, the official city colors of <span class="pgh-black">black</span> and <span class="pgh-gold">gold</span>.

      <h3>Downtown to Neighborhoods</h3>
      <p>I will admit the city looks cool, but try navigating through it. The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle, and four main areas surrounding it.</p>

        <li>North Side</li>
        <li>South Side</li>
